# bsdutils-extra

Chimera uses https://github.com/dcantrell/bsdutils as its coreutils replacement,
but not all GNU tools are covered under that, and not all FreeBSD tools are made
portable.

Therefore, this project aims to provide permissive-licensed reimplementations of
various GNU/BSD tools that did not/could not make it into `bsdutils`.
